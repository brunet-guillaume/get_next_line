Project in the first circle in 42 school.

## Mandatory part

The idea here, is to write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.

Each time the function is called, the next line is returned.

When this is the end of the file, NULL is returned.

## Bonus part

Same as the mandatory part, but with multiples file descriptors.
